#Angular
## File naming and variable names
### What
Name HTML files as though they are views itself.
eg) main.html, main-subpage1.html
Name JS files as though they are controllers itself
eg) main.js / main,  main.subpage1.js / main.subpage1
### Why
Normally people name controller files as for example "mainController.js" / "MainController" that's just unnecessarily long, and by using . notation and lowercases only we can consistently assume names with that format is a controller.
